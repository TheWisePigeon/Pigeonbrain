This week I have been working full time on [[Visio]] and now that the small and easy stuff are all pretty much done it is time to move to the more complex stuff that I have never worked on.
Today I am implementing **[[Internet Protocol#IP Address| IP address]] based [[Rate Limiting| rate limiting]]** for the `/api` endpoints.


It is now 9PM and I haven't had the time to work on the rate limiting.
